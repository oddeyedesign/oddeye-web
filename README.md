# Web Design Class Final Project

As my first website, I decided to develop my own Porfolio to showcase my work and creativity.

I've designed my brand with an extraterrestrial concept, featuring a logo of a shape-shifting alien cat with three eyes. I aimed for the website to be filled with wavy shapes to give it a more playful look in line with the brand. The main colors (black, violet, and phosphorescent green) contribute to that quirky extraterrestrial feel. I crafted this website with the idea of making it an interactive experience, allowing users to 'play' with it and immerse themselves in the concept. That's why the logo is interactive, following your gaze. I also added a toggle for a 'light/dark mode,' transforming the website into its opposite: straight shapes, sepia tones, and a more subdued look, aptly named 'Incognito Mode.' Essentially, it turns the web into its 'disguised as a human' version, hiding the alien to blend into human society and, consequently, the corporate environment. With all this, I aimed to represent my experience as an autistic person in this world: when in society, I activate my incognito mode so no one sees the 'alien' behind it.

The website is not perfect at all, as I've just begun my development adventure. I will be continuously updating and improving it in the future, suggestions are more than welcome!

## Features
